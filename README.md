<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

So many books, so little time! I find new books to read faster than I can read them. Keeping track of all of them and remembering the order I want to read them can be cumbersome (plus I'm very forgetful and can't remember the books that I've read). 

I created this app based around creating and organizing "book playlists" similar to how Apple Music and Spotify shows your queued songs. 

### How It's Made

**Tech used:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/)

The Book data comes from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using). Books saved to your playlist are saved to MongoDB.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This API can be accessed via [https://bookly-crud-app.herokuapp.com/](https://bookly-crud-app.herokuapp.com/) or as a local copy. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

### Usage

1. Run server
   ```sh
    node server.js
    npm run dev  // nodemon command
   ```
2. Navigate to server
   ```sh
   `localhost:8000`
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] 
- [ ] Sorteable playlists (drag and drop and sort) feature
- [ ] Completed books page
- [ ] Login 

See the [open issues](https://github.com/danjkim21/adv-nuclear-reactor-api/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Lessons Learned:

My biggest take away is how powerful JavaScript is as a language. Prior to this project, I assumed that I would always need Python to scrape any web content. After finding Cheerio, scraping content became--dare I say--a much less daunting experience due to how intuitive and easy to use Cheerio is.
